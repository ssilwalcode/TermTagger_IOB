"This article deals with deverbal nominalizations in Spanish ; concretely , we focus on the denotative distinction between event and result nominalizations .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The goals of this work is twofold : ﬁrst , to detect the most relevant features for this denotative distinction ; and , second , to build an automatic classiﬁcation system of deverbal nominalizations according to their denotation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have based our study on theoretical hypotheses dealing with this semantic distinction and we have analyzed them empirically by means of Machine Learning techniques which are the basis of the ADN - Classiﬁer .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B O O O
"This is the ﬁrst tool that aims to automatically classify deverbal nominalizations in event , result , or underspeciﬁed denotation types in Spanish .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
The ADN - Classiﬁer has helped us to quantitatively evaluate the validity of our claims regarding deverbal nominalizations .,O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We set up a series of experiments in order to test the ADN - Classiﬁer with different models and in different realistic scenarios depending on the knowledge resources and natural language processors available .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ADN - Classiﬁer achieved good results ( 87.20 % accuracy ) .,O B O O O O O O B I O O O
"Although there has been much work in recent years on data - driven natural language generation , little attention has been paid to the fine - grained interactions that arise during microplanning between aggregation , surface realization , and sentence segmentation .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this article , we propose a hybrid symbolic / statistical approach to jointly model the constraints regulating these interactions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Our approach integrates a small handwritten grammar , a statistical hypertagger , and a surface realization algorithm .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is applied to the verbalization of knowledge base queries and tested on 13 knowledge bases to demonstrate domain independence .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
We evaluate our approach in several ways .,O O O O O O O O
A quantitative analysis shows that the hybrid approach outperforms a purely symbolic approach in terms of both speed and coverage .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Results from a human study indicate that users find the output of this hybrid statistic / symbolic system more fluent than both a template - based and a purely symbolic grammar based approach .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Finally , we illustrate by means of examples that our approach can account for various factors impacting aggregation , sentence segmentation , and surface realization .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present a statistical parsing framework for sentence - level sentiment classification in this article .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Unlike previous works that use syntactic parsing results for sentiment analysis , we develop a statistical parser to directly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We show that complicated phenomena in sentiment analysis ( e.g. , negation , intensification , and contrast ) can be handled the same way as simple and straightforward sentiment expressions in a unified and probabilistic way .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We formulate the sentiment grammar upon Context - Free Grammars ( CFGs ) , and provide a formal description of the sentiment parsing framework .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We develop the parsing model to obtain possible sentiment parse trees for a sentence , from which the polarity model is proposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity , and the ranking model is dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We train the parser directly from examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but without any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents within sentences .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore we can obtain training data easily .,O O O O O O O O
"In particular , we train a sentiment parser , s.parser , from a large amount of review sentences with users ' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Extensive experiments on existing benchmark data sets show significant improvements over baseline sentiment classification approaches .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Orthographic similarities across languages provide a strong signal for unsupervised probabilistic transduction ( decipherment ) for closely related language pairs .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The existing decipherment models , however , are not well suited for exploiting these orthographic similarities .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We propose a log - linear model with latent variables that incorporates orthographic similarity features .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maximum likelihood training is computationally expensive for the proposed log - linear model .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To address this challenge , we perform approximate inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and contrastive divergence .",O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O
Our results show that the proposed log - linear model with contrastive divergence outperforms the existing generative decipherment models by exploiting the orthographic features .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The model both scales to large vocabularies and preserves accuracy in low- and no - resource contexts .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present algorithms for extracting Hyperedge Replacement Grammar ( HRG ) rules from a graph along with a vertex order .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Our algorithms are based on finding a tree decomposition of smallest width , relative to the vertex order , and then extracting one rule for each node in this structure .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"The assumption of a fixed order for the vertices of the input graph makes it possible to solve the problem in polynomial time , in contrast to the fact that the problem of finding optimal tree decompositions for a graph is NP - hard .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
"We also present polynomial - time algorithms for parsing based on our HRGs , where the input is a vertex sequence and the output is a graph structure .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The intended application of our algorithms is grammar extraction and parsing for semantic representation of natural language .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We apply our algorithms to data annotated with Abstract Meaning Representations and report on the characteristics of the resulting grammars .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"As more and more Arabic textual information becomes available through the Web in homes and businesses , via Internet and Intranet services , there is an urgent need for technologies and tools to process the relevant information .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) is an Information Extraction task that has become an integral part of many other Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) tasks , such as Machine Translation and Information Retrieval .",O O O O B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O B I I I I O
Arabic NER has begun to receive attention in recent years .,B B O O O O O O B I O
"The characteristics and peculiarities of Arabic , a member of the Semitic languages family , make dealing with NER a challenge .",O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O
The performance of an Arabic NER component affects the overall performance of the NLP system in a positive manner .,O O O O B B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
This article attempts to describe and detail the recent increase in interest and progress made in Arabic NER research .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B B O O
"The importance of the NER task is demonstrated , the main characteristics of the Arabic language are highlighted , and the aspects of standardization in annotating named entities are illustrated .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , the different Arabic linguistic resources are presented and the approaches used in Arabic NER field are explained .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B B O O O O
"The features of common tools used in Arabic NER are described , and standard evaluation metrics are illustrated .",O O O O O O O B B O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , a review of the state of the art of Arabic NER research is discussed .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B B O O O O
"Finally , we present our conclusions .",O O O O O O O
"Throughout the presentation , illustrative examples are used for clarification .",O O O O O O O O O O O
Translation models used for statistical machine translation are compiled from parallel corpora that are manually translated .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The common assumption is that parallel texts are symmetrical : The direction of translation is deemed irrelevant and is consequently ignored .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Much research in Translation Studies indicates that the direction of translation matters , however , as translated language ( translationese ) has many unique properties .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has already been shown that phrase tables constructed from parallel corpora translated in the same direction as the translation task outperform those constructed from corpora translated in the opposite direction .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
"We reconfirm that this is indeed the case , but emphasize the importance of also using texts translated in the “ wrong ” direction .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We take advantage of information pertaining to the direction of translation in constructing phrase tables by adapting the translation model to the special properties of translationese .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We explore two adaptation techniques : First , we create a mixture model by interpolating phrase tables trained on texts translated in the “ right ” and the “ wrong ” directions .",O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The weights for the interpolation are determined by minimizing perplexity .,O O O O O O O O O O O
"Second , we define entropy - based measures that estimate the correspondence of target - language phrases to translationese , thereby eliminating the need to annotate the parallel corpus with information pertaining to the direction of translation .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We show that incorporating these measures as features in the phrase tables of statistical machine translation systems results in consistent , statistically significant improvement in the quality of the translation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Weighted deduction systems provide a framework for describing parsing algorithms that can be used with a variety of operations for combining the values of partial derivations .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"For some operations , inside values can be computed efficiently , but outside values can not .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We view out - side values as functions from inside values to the total value of all derivations , and we analyze outside computation in terms of function composition .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This viewpoint helps explain why efficient outside computation is possible in many settings , despite the lack of a general outside algorithm for semiring operations .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many NLP applications entail that texts are classified based on their semantic distance ( how similar or different the texts are ) .,O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"For example , comparing the text of a new document to that of documents of known topics can help identify the topic of the new text .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Typically , a distributional distance is used to capture the implicit semantic distance between two pieces of text .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
"However , such approaches do not take into account the semantic relations between words .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this article , we introduce an alternative method of measuring the semantic distance between texts that integrates distributional information and ontological knowledge within a network flow formalism .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We first represent each text as a collection of frequency - weighted concepts within an ontology .,O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We then make use of a network flow method which provides an efficient way of explicitly measuring the frequency - weighted ontological distance between the concepts across two texts .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"We evaluate our method in a variety of NLP tasks , and find that it performs well on two of three tasks .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O
"We develop a new measure of semantic coherence that enables us to account for the performance difference across the three data sets , shedding light on the properties of a data set that lends itself well to our method .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Recent work in natural language generation has begun to take linguistic variation into account , developing algorithms that are capable of modifying the system 's linguistic style based either on the user 's linguistic style or other factors , such as personality or politeness .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"While stylistic control has traditionally relied on handcrafted rules , statistical methods are likely to be needed for generation systems to scale to the production of the large range of variation observed in human dialogues .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous work on statistical natural language generation ( SNLG ) has shown that the grammaticality and naturalness of generated utterances can be optimized from data ; however these data - driven methods have not been shown to produce stylistic variation that is perceived by humans in the way that the system intended .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This paper describes Personage , a highly parameterizable language generator whose parameters are based on psychological findings about the linguistic reflexes of personality .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present a novel SNLG method which uses parameter estimation models trained on personality - annotated data to predict the generation decisions required to convey any combination of scalar values along the five main dimensions of personality .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"A human evaluation shows that parameter estimation models produce recognizable stylistic variation along multiple dimensions , on a continuous scale , and without the computational cost incurred by overgeneration techniques .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this work , we present a phenomenon - oriented comparative analysis of the two dominant approaches in English Resource Semantic ( ERS ) parsing : classic , knowledge - intensive and neural , data - intensive models .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To reflect state - of - the - art neural NLP technologies , a factorization - based parser is introduced that can produce Elementary Dependency Structures much more accurately than previous data - driven parsers .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"We conduct a suite of tests for different linguistic phenomena to analyze the grammatical competence of different parsers , where we show that , despite comparable performance overall , knowledge- and data - intensive models produce different types of errors , in a way that can be explained by their theoretical properties .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This analysis is beneficial to in - depth evaluation of several representative parsing techniques and leads to new directions for parser development .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Systems based on synchronous grammars and tree transducers promise to improve the quality of statistical machine translation output , but are often very computationally intensive .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The complexity is exponential in the size of individual grammar rules due to arbitrary re orderings between the two languages .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
We develop a theory of binarization for synchronous context free grammars and present a linear time algorithm for binarizing synchronous rules when possible .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In our large scale experiments , we found that almost all rules are binarizable and the resulting binarized rule set significantly improves the speed and accuracy of a state of the art syntax based machine translation system .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We also discuss the more general , and computationally more difficult , problem of finding good parsing strategies for non binarizable rules , and present an approximate polynomial time algorithm for this problem .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The most common approach in text mining classification tasks is to rely on features like words , part - of - speech tags , stems , or some other high - level linguistic features .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Recently , an approach that uses only character p - grams as features has been proposed for the task of native language identification ( NLI ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The approach obtained state - of - the - art results by combining several string kernels using multiple kernel learning .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"Despite the fact that the approach based on string kernels performs so well , several questions about this method remain unanswered .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"First , it is not clear why such a simple approach can compete with far more complex approaches that take words , lemmas , syntactic information , or even semantics into account .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
"Second , although the approach is designed to be language independent , all experiments to date have been on English .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
This work is an extensive study that aims to systematically present the string kernel approach and to clarify the open questions mentioned above .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A broad set of native language identification experiments were conducted to compare the string kernels approach with other state - of - the - art methods .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The empirical results obtained in all of the experiments conducted in this work indicate that the proposed approach achieves state - of - the - art performance in NLI , reaching an accuracy that is 1.7 % above the top scoring system of the 2013 NLI Shared Task .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B B I I O
"Furthermore , the results obtained on both the Arabic and the Norwegian corpora demonstrate that the proposed approach is language independent .",O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O
"In the Arabic native language identification task , string kernels show an increase of more than 17 % over the best accuracy reported so far .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
The results of string kernels on Norwegian native language identification are also significantly better than the state - of - the - art approach .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , in a cross - corpus experiment , the proposed approach shows that it can also be topic independent , improving the state - of - the - art system by 32.3 % .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"To gain additional insights about the string kernels approach , the features selected by the classifier as being more discriminating are analyzed in this work .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The analysis also offers information about localized language transfer effects , since the features used by the proposed model are p - grams of various lengths .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The features captured by the model typically include stems , function words , and word prefixes and suffixes , which have the potential to generalize over purely word - based features .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"By analyzing the discriminating features , this article offers insights into two kinds of language transfer effects , namely , word choice ( lexical transfer ) and morphological differences .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The goal of the current study is to give a full view of the string kernels approach and shed some light on why this approach works so well .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
